## MsgCreatePrivatePlan

Either `Denom` or `PairId` must be specified in a `RewardAllocation`, but not
both.

type MsgCreatePrivatePlan struct {
    Creator           string
    Description       string
    RewardAllocations []RewardAllocation
    StartTime         time.Time
    EndTime           time.Time
}

type RewardAllocation struct {
    PairId        uint64
    Denom         string
    RewardsPerDay sdk.DecCoins
}
```

## MsgFarm

```go
type MsgFarm struct {
    Farmer string
    Coin   sdk.Coin
}
```

## MsgUnfarm

```go
type MsgUnfarm struct {
    Farmer string
    Coin   sdk.Coin
}
