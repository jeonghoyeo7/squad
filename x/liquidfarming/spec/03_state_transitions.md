# State Transitions

This document describes the state transaction operations in the `liquidfarming` module.

## Parameter Change for Activated Liquid Farms

### Activation of a Liquid Farm

When a new `liquidFarm` with a given pool id is registered to the parameter `LiquidFarms` by governance, the `liquidFarm` with the pool id becomes activated and added to the state `LiquidFarms`.

### Deactivation of a Liquid Farm

When a `liquidFarm` with a given pool id in the parameter `LiquidFarms` is removed by governance, the `liquidFarm` becomes deactivated and deleted in the state `LiquidFarms`.
When the `liquidFarm` becomes deactivated, the module unstakes all pool coins for the `liquidFarm`.
